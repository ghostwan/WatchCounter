WatchCounter
============

This is the first draft of WatchCounter, a simple android wear counter that allow you to count anything !!

Purpose
=======

I create this application to count my NiQuitin consomation throught the day when I decided to stop smoking. 
I set a warning delay (with the phone WatchCounter app) to warn me when I should not (red background) or could take another sweet.
Each day (reset interval) the counter reset to 0 and add the past day count to my total count.

Road map
========
- Have an history (day/week/month) of the count and display it graphical representation on the phone
- Average count, Average time
- Create multiples counter and find a smart way to display them on the watch
